# Research Program: an executable design for the 50-question agenda

This operationalizes [`RESEARCH_AGENDA.md`](RESEARCH_AGENDA.md) into a program that runs continuously,
wave by wave, without per-project check-ins. Each of the 50 questions becomes a project with a
concrete method, the reusable infrastructure it uses, an expected artifact, and a feasibility lane.
Projects that cannot run autonomously (external data, human subjects, unavailable tooling) are routed
to a parking lane so the loop never stalls on them.

## How to run it continuously

**The loop, per project.** Write a probe script `probes/probe_<slug>.py` (or a sub-experiment folder
for larger studies) → run it on `~/iit-playground/venv-4.0/bin/python -m org_frontier...` → append one
row to the status table below and a result block to `probes/PROBES.md` (continuing the numbering past
53) → after a wave of ~5, make one commit of `org_frontier/`, fast-forward `main`, push, leave the
`dissertation/` working-tree edits untouched. Report once per wave, not per project.

**Definition of done (per project).** A committed script, a result with exact numbers, and a log entry
stating question / hypothesis / method / result, honest about nulls and refutations. Apply the
rate-it discipline: a vivid named-form result is an existence proof; rate it against a population
before stating it as general.

**Cadence.** ~5 projects per wave (the established batch size). Continue wave after wave until the
runnable set (Lane R) is exhausted; background the heavy ones (Lane X); document and skip the parked
lanes (T, D, H). Heavy/background runs use `run_in_background`; the loop proceeds to the next project
while they compute.

**Stop conditions.** Only three: a project is blocked (route to its parking lane and continue, do not
stall), a hard tool failure that cannot be worked around, or all Lane-R/Lane-X projects are done.

## Feasibility lanes

- **R — runnable now.** Uses existing infrastructure; foreground or quick. The bulk of the program.
- **X — heavy compute.** Full or large-sample enumerations / per-form CES or emergence; run in the
  background or by sampling, and log what was sampled vs censused.
- **T — needs tooling not on this branch.** Multi-valued PyPhi (#5), an IIT-3.0 config/install (#8).
  Attempt the install once; if blocked, document and park.
- **D — needs external data.** Real organizational logs (#24). Stage a protocol and a synthetic
  stand-in; do not fabricate data.
- **H — needs humans.** A lab experiment (#41), inter-rater coding (#42). Produce the design and
  pre-registration only; cannot be run autonomously.

## Reusable infrastructure (cite these in each script)

- `classifier/classifier.py`: `classify_rules`, `classify`, `tpm_from_rules`, `cm_from_rules`,
  `Verdict`, `PHI_EPS`.
- `probes/lib.py`: `verdict`, `major_complex`, `max_phi_float` (exact Φ on stochastic TPMs);
  `probes/_info.py`: `entropy`, `mutual_information`, `transfer_entropy`, `o_information`.
- `proxy_audit/exact_phi.py`: `exact_big_phi`, `reachable_states`, `network_phi`, `simulate_trajectory`.
- `proxy_bridge/bridge.py`: `add_noise`. `phyid.calculate.calc_PhiID`.
- `emergence_vs_phi/emergence.py`: `effective_information`, `macro_tpm`, `causal_emergence`.
- `corpus/population.py`: `enumerate_family` (256 strict-mediation n=3 forms); `corpus/forms_library.py`.
- `multiparty/scaling.py`: `sample_form(n)`. `structure_suite/suite.py`: `extract_suite`
  (distinctions/relations). `probes/probe_variance.py`: `success_rate`.

## Conventions (carried from the lab)

- House style in all prose (`CLAUDE.md`): no first person; short blunt claims; one em-dash per
  paragraph; no "Crucially/Importantly", no "not X but Y", no breathless adjectives.
- Validate any new instrument on its own controls before trusting a verdict (the playbook's rule).
- Read the verdict on the major complex when a form may have spectator nodes; otherwise on
  whole-system Φ over the MIP.
- Commit per wave; ff `main`; push; stage `org_frontier/` only, leaving the `dissertation/` edits
  untouched. Log every project in `probes/PROBES.md` with question/hypothesis/method/result.
- Report honestly: refutations and nulls are first-class results and are logged as such.
